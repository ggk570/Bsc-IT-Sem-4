#### <span style="color:blue;">1. Explain predefined classes related to System.Exception.</span>
1. In ASP.NET and C#, exceptions are handled using a hierarchy of predefined classes under the `System.Exception` namespace
2. Here’s a breakdown of some key predefined exception classes and their purposes
	1. **System.Exception:** All exceptions are derive from this class. It provides properties like `Message`, `StackTrace`, and methods like `ToString()` for exception handling.
	2. **System.SystemException:** This class serves as a base for predefined system exceptions. It includes exceptions that are generated by the .NET runtime, such as:
		- **ArgumentNullException**: Thrown when a null argument is passed to a method that does not accept it.
		- **IndexOutOfRangeException**: Thrown when an index is outside the bounds of an array or collection.
		- **InvalidOperationException**: Thrown when a method call is invalid for the object's current state.
	3. **System.ApplicationException:** This class is intended to be a base class for user-defined application exceptions. However, its usage is less common in modern applications, as developers often derive from `System.Exception` directly.

#### <span style="color:blue;">2. What are server side state management techniques? Explain it.</span>
1. State Management can be defined as the technique or the way by which we can maintain/store the state of the page or application until the User's Session ends.
2. Server-side state management in ASP.NET refers to techniques for preserving user and application state across multiple requests. This is essential for web applications, as HTTP is stateless. For this type the state data is stored on server side.
3. A web application can employ various methods to manage state.
4. Some of the server side state management techniques are discussed below:
	1. **Session State:** Stores user data for the duration of the user’s session with the application. It is accessed via `HttpContext.Current.Session`. It allows you to store complex objects, which are serialized when stored. Session state lasts until the user closes the browser or the session times out. By default session data is stored in **InProcMode** which means the value is stored in IIS web server memory. It can be stored in **State Server Mode** which means data is stored in a separate process called Asp.Net state service. Session data can also be stored in database with the help of **Sql Server Mode**.
	2. **Application State:** Stores global data accessible to all users and sessions. It is stored in server memory. It stores information as a Dictionary Collection in key-value pairs. This value is accessible across the pages of the application/website. It is accessed via `HttpContext.Current.Application`. It's useful for storing application-wide settings or counters. The application state lasts for the life of the application and is shared among all users.
	3. **Cache:** The cache is stored on the server side. It implements Page Caching and data caching. The cache is used to set expiration policies

#### <span style="color:blue;">3. Illustrate use of cookies in asp.net application with a suitable example.</span>
1. Cookies are used to store small amounts of data on the client’s browser, which can be sent back to the server with each request.
2. Cookies provides us a way to manage state and other user specific configurations.
3. We can create a cookie with HttpCookie object and set this cookie by using Response.Cookies object.
4. To retrieve a cookie, we can use the Request.Cookies object
`Request.Cookies['cookieName'].value`
5. Cookie's common property
	1. Domain => This is used to associate cookies to domain.
	2. Secure  => We can enable secure cookie to set true(HTTPs).
	3. Value    => We can manipulate individual cookie.
	4. Values  => We can manipulate cookies with key/value pair.
	5. Expires => This is used to set expire date for the cookies.

#### <span style="color:blue;">4. What is theme? Explain Global Theme.</span>
1. In ASP.NET, a **theme** is a way to define a consistent look and feel for your web application.
2. Themes allow you to apply a specific style across all pages of an application without having to manually apply styles to each page.
3. This is done by defining styles, images, and other resources that can be reused throughout the application.
4. We define themes in a special App_Themes folder. Inside this folder is one or more subfolders named Theme1, Theme2 etc. that define the actual themes. The theme property is applied late in the page's life cycle, effectively overriding any customization you may have for individual controls on your page.
5. Key Components of a theme:
	1. **Skin Files:** These are `.skin` files that contain the layout and default properties for ASP.NET server controls (like buttons, labels, etc.). You can define how each control should look in a particular theme.
	2. **CSS Files:** You can include CSS files to style your pages consistently across different themes.
	3. **Images:** Themes can also include images that can be used in your application.
6. Themes can be set by following methods:
	1. Setting the theme at the page level: the Theme attribute is added to the page directive of the page.	`<%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeFile="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="Default" Theme="Theme1"%>`
	2. Setting global theme by adding theme attribute to page tag in web.config file of our web application.
	3. Setting the theme programmatically at runtime: here the theme is set at runtime through coding. It should be applied earlier in the page's life cycle ie. Page_PreInit event should be handled for setting the theme. The better option is to apply this to the Base page class of the site as every page in the site inherits from this class.
	`Page.Theme = Theme1;`
7. **Global Theme:**
	1. A **global theme** is a theme that applies to all pages in the application. It can be specified in the `web.config` file or can be set to be the default theme for the application.
	2. To set global theme we can set the theme in the web.config of the website. Open the web.config file and locate the `<pages>` element and add the theme attribute to it:
	`<pages theme="Theme1">`
	`...`
	`</pages>`
8. **Uses of Themes**
	1. Since themes can contain CSS files, images and skins, you can change colors, fonts, positioning and images simply by applying the desired themes.
	2. You can have as many themes as you want and you can switch between them by setting a single attribute in the web.config file or an individual aspx page. Also you can switch between themes programmatically.
	3. Setting the themes programmatically, you are offering your users a quick and easy way to change the page to their likings. 
	4. Themes allow you to improve the usability of your site by giving users with vision problems the option to select a high contrast theme with a large font size.

#### <span style="color:blue;">5. What is Master Page? How is it utilized is asp.net.</span>
1. A **Master Page** in ASP.NET is a template that defines a common layout for multiple pages in an application.
2. A single master page defines the look and feel and standard behavior that we want for all of the pages (or a group of pages) in our application.
3. We can then create individual content pages that contain the content we want to display.
4. When users request the content pages, they merge with the master page to produce output that combines the layout of the master page with the content from the content page.
5. Key Features of Master Pages
	1. **Layout Consistency**: A Master Page contains the layout elements that you want to share across multiple pages, such as headers, footers, and navigation menus.
	2. **Content Placeholders**: It includes **ContentPlaceHolder** controls where individual pages (content pages) can inject their unique content. This allows for a dynamic layout while maintaining a consistent look.
	3. **Single Point of Update**: Changes made to the Master Page automatically propagate to all associated content pages, simplifying maintenance.
6. To create a master page, add a new item in Visual Studio then click Master Page.
7. Define the layout using HTML and ASP.NET controls, placing **ContentPlaceHolder** controls where dynamic content should go.
8. A sample master page:
```
<%@ Master Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeFile="Site.master.cs" Inherits="SiteMaster" %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title><asp:ContentPlaceHolder ID="TitleContent" runat="server" /></title>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>My Website</h1>
    </header>
    <div>
        <asp:ContentPlaceHolder ID="MainContent" runat="server" />
    </div>
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2024 My Website</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```
9. Now add a webform to your project and fill the contentplaceholder with appropriate content
```
<%@ Page Title="Home Page" Language="C#" MasterPageFile="~/Site.master" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeFile="Home.aspx.cs" Inherits="Home" %>
<asp:Content ID="Content1" ContentPlaceHolderID="MainContent" runat="server">
    <h2>Welcome to My Website</h2>
    <p>This is the home page.</p>
</asp:Content>
```
10. When the application is run, ASP.NET combines the Master Page and the content from the content pages to generate a complete HTML page.

#### <span style="color:blue;">6. Explain Page Tracing in Asp.Net with an example.</span>
1. Page tracing enables you to view diagnostic information about a single request for an ASP.NET page.
2. It enables you to follow a page's execution path, display diagnostic information at run time, and debug your application. ASP.NET tracing can be integrated with system-level tracing to provide multiple levels of tracing output in distributed and multi-tier applications.
3. We can control whether tracing is enabled or disabled for individual pages. If tracing is enabled, when the page is requested, ASP.NET appends to the page a series of tables containing execution details about the page request. Tracing is disabled by default in an ASP.NET application.
4. To enable tracing for a specific page, you can set the `Trace` property to `true` in the page directive:
	`<% Page Language="C#" Trace="true" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeFile="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="mynamespace.Default" %>`
5. We can also enable tracing globally for all pages in the `web.config` file:
```
<configuration>
  <system.web>
    <trace enabled="true" pageOutput="true" requestLimit="10" localOnly="false" />
  </system.web>
</configuration>
```
6. We can also add custom tracing messages in your code-behind file using `Trace.Write` or `Trace.Warn`.
7. When we run our trace enabled page in a browser, we'll see a trace output at the bottom of the page, which includes:
	- Execution Time: Total time taken for the page to process.
	- Control Hierarchy: A visual representation of the controls on the page.
	- Event Information: A list of page lifecycle events that occurred during the request.
	- Custom Trace Messages: Any messages you added using `Trace.Write` or `Trace.Warn`.
8. Example:
**Default.aspx**
```
<%@ Page Language="C#" Trace="true" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeBehind="Default.aspx.cs" %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Tracing Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the Page Tracing Example</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
**Default.aspx.cs**
```
using System;
using System.Web;

namespace Test{
	public partial class Default: System.Web.UI.Page{
			protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e){
			}
	}
}
```

#### <span style="color:blue;">7. Write a short note on querystring state management technique.</span>
1. **QueryString** is a state management technique in ASP.NET (and web development in general) that involves passing data between web pages through the URL.
2. Query strings are separated from rest of the url using **?** character, the data in query string is stored in key=value format. Each key=value pair is separated from each other using **&** character.
3. Since HTTP is a stateless protocol, query strings help retain information across different requests without storing it on the server.
4. Url with query strings can be generated on the client side with JavaScript code or we can embed static urls with query strings while generating the page on the server side.
	E.g `<a href="user.aspx?username=john">Jump to Dashboard</a>`
5. On server side we can extract data from query string using Request.QueryString collection:
```
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    string name = Request.QueryString["username"];
    Response.Write($"Hello {username}");
}
```

#### <span style="color:blue;">8. Develop an asp.net web application to count total number of visitors visited to an asp.net website.</span>
1. To create an asp.net web application that maintains the count of total number of visitors visited to our website, we need to use application and session events.
2. For this we need to add global.asax file, at the Application_Start event we need to initialize a visitorcount application state variable and need to increment it's value whenever a new session is started i.e at Session_Start event.
3. Program:
**Global.asax.cs**
```
using System;
namespace myNamespace{
	public class Global: System.Web.HttpApplication{
		protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e){
			Application["visitorNo"] = 0;
		}
		protected void Session_Start(object sender, EventArgs e){
			Application.Lock();
		    Application["visitorNo"] = (int)Application["visitorNo"] + 1;
		    Application.UnLock();
		}
	}
}
```
**Default.aspx**
```
<% Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeBehind="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="myNamespace.Default" %>
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head runat="server">
    <title></title>
</head>
<body>
    <form id="form1" runat="server">
        <div>
			<p>Hello, your visitor number is : </p>
            <asp:Label ID="VisitorNo" runat="server"></asp:Label>
            <br /><br />
        </div>
    </form>
</body>
```
**Default.aspx.cs**
```
using System;
myNamespace{
	public partial class Default: System.Web.UI.Page{
		protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e){
			VisitorNo.Text = Application["visitorNo"].ToString();
		}
	}
}
```

#### <span style="color:blue;">9. What is CSS? List and explain types of css.</span>
1. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML
2. CSS is essential for controlling the layout, design, and visual appearance of web pages.
3. **Types of CSS:**
	1. **Inline CSS:** Inline CSS is used to apply styles directly to individual HTML elements or server controls using the `style` attribute.
	`<asp:Label ID="lblMessage" runat="server" Text="Hello, World!" style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"></asp:Label>`
	2. **Internal CSS:** It is defined within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of an HTML document or an ASPX page.
	```
	<head runat="server">
    <title>My ASP.NET Page</title>
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: #f0f0f0;
        }
        .header {
            color: green;
            font-size: 24px;
        }
    </style>
	</head>
	```
	3. **External CSS:** External CSS is written in a separate `.css` file, which is linked to one or more HTML documents. This method is ideal for larger projects where multiple pages need to share the same styles.
	**styles.css**
	```
	body {
	    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
	    margin: 0;
	    padding: 0;
	}
	.header {
	    color: #333;
	    text-align: center;
	}
	```
	**Default.aspx**
	```
	<head runat="server">
    <title>My ASP.NET Page</title>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
	</head>
	```

#### <span style="color:blue;">10. What is theme? Explain how to create and use theme.</span>
1. In ASP.NET, a **theme** is a way to define a consistent look and feel for your web application.
2. Themes allow you to apply a specific style across all pages of an application without having to manually apply styles to each page.
3. This is done by defining styles, images, and other resources that can be reused throughout the application.
4. We define themes in a special App_Themes folder. Inside this folder is one or more subfolders named Theme1, Theme2 etc. that define the actual themes. The theme property is applied late in the page's life cycle, effectively overriding any customization you may have for individual controls on your page.
5. To create themes first we need to open our asp.net project in visual studio and add a new folder App_Themes. Inside this folder create a subfolder representing our theme e.g Default.
6. Now we need to add skin file in our Default theme folder. Skin file contains the layout and default properties for ASP.NET server controls (like buttons, labels, etc.). You can define how each control should look in a particular theme. Skin files can be added by right clicking on our Default theme folder in solution explorer tab in visual studio.
7. We can now add server controls and style them in our skin file, if we want we can style the controls using external css, this would be helpful for large projects:
**default.skin**
```
<asp:Label runat="server" SkinID="Label1" Text="Hello World" CssClass="lbl" />
<asp:Button runat="server" SkinID="Button1" Text="Click Me" CssClass="btn" />
```
8. The SkinID attribute is used to link controls from skin file to web form pages
9. We can now add a css file, it is similar to adding skin file and style our controls in this css file.
**default.css**
```
body {
    background-color: #ace5ea;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
.lbl{
    color:darkred;
}
.btn {
    background-color: #007bff;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 5px;
}
```
9. At last we can add a webform with visual studio, let's say our webform name is **Default.aspx**. Now we have set the theme attribute in the page directive of our new page.
```
<%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeBehind="WebForm1.aspx.cs" Inherits="Practice.WebForm1" Theme="Default" %>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head runat="server">
    <title></title>
</head>
<body>
    <form id="form1" runat="server">
        <div>
            <asp:Label SkinID="Label1" ID="Label1" runat="server"></asp:Label>
            <br /><br />
            <asp:Button SkinID="Button1" ID="Button1" runat="server" />
        </div>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```
10. Now build the application and visit the page in web browser

#### <span style="color:blue;">11. Describe the use of multiple catch statements in exception handling using example.</span>
1. In C#, multiple `catch` statements can be used to handle different types of exceptions that may occur in a `try` block.
2. This allows us to respond differently depending on the type of exception encountered, improving error handling and providing more meaningful feedback to users or developers.
3. The general syntax for multiple catch statements is:
```
try
{
    // Code that may throw exceptions
}
catch (ExceptionType1 ex1)
{
    // Handle ExceptionType1
}
catch (ExceptionType2 ex2)
{
    // Handle ExceptionType2
}
catch (Exception ex) // This can catch any other exception
{
    // Handle general exceptions
}
```
4. Example:
```
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        try
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Enter a number to divide 100 by:");
            string input = Console.ReadLine();
            int number = Convert.ToInt32(input); // This may throw FormatException
            int result = 100 / number; // This may throw DivideByZeroException
            Console.WriteLine($"Result: 100 / {number} = {result}");
        }
        catch (FormatException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Error: Please enter a valid integer. " + ex.Message);
        }
        catch (DivideByZeroException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Error: Cannot divide by zero. " + ex.Message);
        }
        catch (Exception ex) // General exception handling
        {
            Console.WriteLine("An unexpected error occurred: " + ex.Message);
        }
        finally
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Execution finished.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### <span style="color:blue;">12. Explain the events in global.asax with respect to state management.</span>
1. In ASP.NET, the `Global.asax` file, also known as the application file, is used to handle application-level events and manage application-wide state.
2. It can contain event handlers for various application lifecycle events that are critical for managing state and resources throughout the application's lifetime.
3. Here are the main events found in `Global.asax` that relate to state management:
	1. **Application_Start:** This event is triggered when the application starts for the first time or when it is restarted. It's an ideal place to initialize application-wide resources, such as database connections or application-level variables.
	2. **Application_End:** This event occurs when the application is being shut down. You can use it to clean up resources, like closing database connections.
	3. **Session_Start:** This event is triggered when a new user session is created. It’s useful for initializing session-specific variables.
	4. **Session_End:** This event occurs when a user session ends, either due to timeout or because the user logs out. It can be used to clean up session-specific data.
	5. **Application_BeginRequest:** This event is triggered at the beginning of each HTTP request. You can use it for processing before any specific page request, like logging or authentication checks.
	6. **Application_EndRequest:** This event occurs at the end of each HTTP request. It can be used to finalize logging or to clear up resources that were allocated for the request.
4. Example:
**Global.asax**
```
<%@ Application Language="C#" %>
<script runat="server">
void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Application["VisitorCount"] = 0; // Initialize visitor count
}
void Session_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Session["UserName"] = "Guest"; // Set default session variable
    Application["VisitorCount"] = (int)Application["VisitorCount"] + 1; // Increment visitor count
}
void Session_End(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Optionally clean up session-related data
}
void Application_End(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Final cleanup if necessary
}
</script>
```

#### <span style="color:blue;">13. What is URL Mapping? How is url mapping and routing implemented in asp.net?</span>
1. **URL Mapping** refers to the process of associating a specific URL with a particular resource, such as a web page, API endpoint, or handler in a web application. This technique helps create more user-friendly URLs
2. In ASP.NET, URL mapping is typically handled through **routing**, which allows developers to define how incoming URLs should be processed and which resources should be returned.
3. Routing can help to create clean, readable URLs that map to server-side logic.
4. In ASP.NET Web Forms, routing can be configured in the `Global.asax` file using the `RouteTable` class.
5. In the `Global.asax` file, add routes in the `Application_Start` method.
```
using System.Web.Routing;

public class Global : HttpApplication
{
    void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes);
    }

    public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
    {
        routes.MapPageRoute("HomeRoute", "home", "~/Default.aspx");
        routes.MapPageRoute("AboutRoute", "about", "~/About.aspx");
    }
}
```
6. The above setup maps the URL `/home` to `Default.aspx` and `/about` to `About.aspx`. Users can access these pages using clean URLs instead of the default ASP.NET file-based structure.

#### <span style="color:blue;">14. What is cross page posting? Explain with an example.</span>
1. **Cross Page Posting** in ASP.NET allows a form on one page to post its data to another page rather than to the page that contains the form.
2.  It can be useful for creating multi-page forms that gather information on each page.
3. By default, buttons and other controls that cause a postback on an ASP.NET Web page submit the page back to itself. However with cross page posting, clicking such controls sends the data to a specified page.
4. Cross page posting is achieved by setting PostBackUrl property of control like button. The value of postbackurl property is set to a target url where data needs to send and handle.
5. Example - Let's create a simple example where a user enters their name on one page and, upon submitting, the data is sent to a second page that displays a greeting message.
**FirstPage.aspx**
```
<%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeFile="FirstPage.aspx.cs" Inherits="FirstPage" %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Source Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form id="form1" runat="server">
        <div>
            <label for="txtName">Enter your name:</label>
            <asp:TextBox ID="txtName" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
            <asp:Button ID="btnSubmit" runat="server" Text="Submit" PostBackUrl="~/TargetPage.aspx" />
        </div>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

**TargetPage.aspx**
```
<%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeFile="TargetPage.aspx.cs" Inherits="TargetPage" %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Target Page</title>

<body>
    <form id="form1" runat="server">
        <div>
            <asp:Label ID="lblGreeting" runat="server" Text=""></asp:Label>
        </div>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```
**TargetPage.aspx.cs**
```
using System;
using System.Web.UI;

public partial class TargetPage : Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Access the previous page and get the data
        if (PreviousPage != null && PreviousPage.IsCrossPagePostBack)
        {
            // Get the value from the SourcePage
            TextBox txtName = (TextBox)PreviousPage.FindControl("txtName");
            if (txtName != null)
            {
                lblGreeting.Text = "Hello, " + txtName.Text + "!";
            }
        }
    }
}

#### <span style="color:blue;">15. What is user defined exception. Explain with example</span>
1. A **user-defined exception** in ASP.NET is a custom exception class inherited from System.Exception class that you create to handle specific error conditions that may arise in your application.
2. By defining your own exceptions, you can provide more meaningful error messages and context, which enhances error handling and debugging.
3. To create a custom exception first we need to create new class that inherits System.Exception class.
4. Then we have to implement constructors to pass custom messages and other relevant information.
5. After creation of our custom exception class we can use the throw keyword to throw exception to represent appropriate error.
6. Example
**InputPage.aspx**
```
<%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeFile="InputPage.aspx.cs" Inherits="InputPage" %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>User Input Validation</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form id="form1" runat="server">
        <div>
            <label for="txtInput">Enter a positive number:</label>
            <asp:TextBox ID="txtInput" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
            <asp:Button ID="btnSubmit" runat="server" Text="Submit" OnClick="btnSubmit_Click" />
            <asp:Label ID="lblMessage" runat="server" ForeColor="Red"></asp:Label>
        </div>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```
**InputPage.aspx.cs**
```
using System;

public class InvalidInputException : Exception
{
    public InvalidInputException() : base("Invalid input provided.")
    {
    }

    public InvalidInputException(string message) : base(message)
    {
    }

    public InvalidInputException(string message, Exception innerException) : base(message, innerException)
    {
    }
}


public partial class InputPage : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void btnSubmit_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        try
        {
            // Get the input value
            string input = txtInput.Text;

            // Validate the input
            if (!int.TryParse(input, out int number) || number <= 0)
            {
                throw new InvalidInputException("Please enter a valid positive number.");
            }

            lblMessage.ForeColor = System.Drawing.Color.Green;
            lblMessage.Text = $"You entered: {number}";
        }
        catch (InvalidInputException ex)
        {
            lblMessage.Text = ex.Message; // Display the custom error message
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            lblMessage.Text = "An unexpected error occurred: " + ex.Message; // General error message
        }
    }
}
```
