##### <span style="color:blue;">1. Provide an explanation for Xml TextWriter class, including its methods.</span>
1. The `XmlTextWriter` class in ASP.NET is part of the `System.Xml` namespace and is used to write XML documents or XML Response in asp.net web applications in a forward-only manner.
2. It provides a simple and efficient way to create XML data, and it's particularly useful for generating XML output in applications.
3. Unlike other XML writers, `XmlTextWriter` writes data in a forward-only fashion which means once we have generated some part of the output we cannot go back to previous element and do any changes, this makes it efficient for generating XML on the fly.
4. It outputs XML as plain text, which can then be written to a stream or a file.
5. It can also be used to create configuration files on the go.
6. Properties of XmlTextWriter class:
	1. **BaseStream:** Gets the underlying stream object.
	2. **Formatting:** Indicates how the output is being formatted.
	3. **Indentation:** Gets or sets how many IndentChars to write for each level in the hierarchy when [Formatting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.xml.xmltextwriter.formatting?view=net-8.0#system-xml-xmltextwriter-formatting) is set to `Formatting.Indented`.
	4. **IndentChar:** Gets or sets which character to use for indenting when [Formatting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.xml.xmltextwriter.formatting?view=net-8.0#system-xml-xmltextwriter-formatting) is set to `Formatting.Indented`.
	5. **WriteState:** Gets the state of the writer.
7. Methods of XmlTextWriter class:
	1. **WriteStartDocument:** Writes the XML declaration (`<?xml version="1.0"?>`).
	2. **WriteStartElement:** Starts a new XML element with the specified name.
	3. **WriteAttributeString:** Writes an attribute with a specified name and value to the current element.
	4. **WriteElementString:** Writes an element with the specified name and text content.
	5. **WriteEndElement:** Closes the current element.
	6. **WriteEndDocument:** Closes the XML document.
	7. **WriteString:** Writes a string value directly to the output.
	8. **Flush:** Ensures that all buffered data is written to the underlying stream.
	9. **Close:** Closes the writer and releases any resources associated with it.

```
using System.Xml;
using System.IO;

public class XmlWriterExample
{
    public void CreateXml()
    {
        using (XmlTextWriter writer = new XmlTextWriter("books.xml", Encoding.UTF8))
        {
            writer.WriteStartDocument();
            writer.WriteStartElement("library");

            writer.WriteStartElement("book");
            writer.WriteAttributeString("genre", "fiction");
            writer.WriteElementString("title", "The Great Gatsby");
            writer.WriteElementString("author", "F. Scott Fitzgerald");
            writer.WriteEndElement(); // book

            writer.WriteEndElement(); // library
            writer.WriteEndDocument();
        }
    }
}
```

##### <span style="color:blue;">2. Describe the process of reading and XML document using the XDocument class.</span>
1. The `XDocument` class in .NET, part of the `System.Xml.Linq` namespace, provides a powerful and flexible way to read and manipulate XML documents using LINQ to XML.
2. This class allows you to load, query, and modify XML in a straightforward manner.
3. To read an xml document using XDocument, we need to follow below steps:
	1. We can load an XML file or a string representation of XML using the `XDocument.Load` method or `XDocument.Parse` method.
	2. Once loaded, we can use LINQ queries to navigate through the XML elements and retrieve data.
	3. We can access elements, attributes, and their values using properties and methods provided by the `XElement` and `XAttribute` classes.
4. Example
Lets assume we have below xml document:
```
<library>
  <book genre="fiction">
    <title>The Great Gatsby</title>
    <author>F. Scott Fitzgerald</author>
  </book>
  <book genre="mystery">
    <title>Gone Girl</title>
    <author>Gillian Flynn</author>
  </book>
</library>
```
C# Program to read this document:
```
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Xml.Linq;

public class XmlReaderExample
{
    public void ReadXml()
    {
        // Load the XML document
        XDocument xdoc = XDocument.Load("books.xml");

        // Query for all book elements
        var books = from book in xdoc.Descendants("book")
                    select new
                    {
                        Title = book.Element("title")?.Value,
                        Author = book.Element("author")?.Value,
                        Genre = book.Attribute("genre")?.Value
                    };

        // Display the books
        foreach (var book in books)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Title: {book.Title}, Author: {book.Author}, Genre: {book.Genre}");
        }
    }
}
```

##### <span style="color:blue;">3. Elaborate Forms Authentication.</span>
1. Forms authentication is a method used in web applications to manage user authentication and authorization.
2. It involves collecting user credentials (typically a username and password) through an HTML form and verifying them against a user database.
3. The forms authentication settings are typically specified in the `Web.config` file of your ASP.NET application.
4. Once authenticated, the user is granted access to restricted resources or functionality within the application.
5. With forms authentication, you have control over the login process. You can design and customize the login page according to your application’s branding and user experience requirements. This flexibility allows you to create a seamless and consistent login experience for your users.
6. Forms authentication typically uses session cookies to manage user sessions. A session cookie is issued to the user upon successful authentication and is used to track subsequent requests. This enables the web application to identify authenticated users without requiring them to reauthenticate for every request. Session management simplifies the user experience and improves performance.
7. Once a user is authenticated, forms authentication allows you to enforce access control policies. You can define different roles or permissions and assign them to users or groups. This enables you to restrict access to specific features, pages, or resources based on the user’s role, enhancing the security of your application.
8. Implementation Steps:
	1. **Configure Web.config:** We need to enable forms authentication in our Web.config
	```
	<configuration>
	  <system.web>
	    <authentication mode="Forms">  
			<forms loginUrl="~/Account/Login.aspx" timeout="2880">  
				<credentials passwordFormat="Clear">  
					<user name="Admin" password="Admin@123"/>  
				</credentials>  
			</forms>  
		</authentication>
		<authorization>  
	        <deny users="?"/>  
		</authorization>
	  </system.web>
	</configuration>
	```
	2. **Create a simple Login.aspx page:** 
	```
	<%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeFile="Login.aspx.cs" Inherits="Login" %>
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
    <title>Login</title>
	</head>
	<body>
    <form id="form1" runat="server">
        <div>
	        <asp:Label ID="UserName_Lbl" runat="server" Text="UserName: ">
	        </asp:Label>
            <asp:TextBox ID="UserName" runat="server" />
	        <asp:Label ID="UserPass_Lbl" runat="server" Text="Password: ">
	        </asp:Label>
            <asp:TextBox ID="UserPass" TextMode="Password" runat="server" />
            <asp:CheckBox ID="chkboxPersist" runat="server" />
            <asp:Button ID="Submit1" OnClick="Login_Click" Text="LogIn" runat="server" />
            <asp:Label ID="Msg" ForeColor="red" runat="server">
            </asp:Label>
        </div>
    </form>
	</body>
	</html>
	```
	3. **Now create the backend logic in Login.aspx.cs:**
	```
	using System;
	using System.Web.UI;
	using System.Web.Security;
	public partial class Login: System.Web.UI.Page{
		protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e){
		}
		protected void Login_Click(object sender, EventArgs e){
			if(FormsAuthentication.Authenticate(Username.Text, UserPass.Text)){
	FormsAuthentication.RedirectFromLoginPage(UserName.Text, chkboxPersist.Checked);
			}
			else{
				Msg.Text = "Invalid User Name and/or Password";
			}
		}
	} 
	```

##### <span style="color:blue;">4. Write a short note on authentication and authorization.</span>
**Authentication:**
1. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or application. It involves verifying user what he claims to be. E.g If a user claims to be admin then using authentication mechanism we would verify if the user is admin or not
2. It involves various different things to verify a user, e.g we could use passwords, pins, user specific questions, or multi-factor authentication which involves a combination of these mechanisms.
3. In Asp.Net authentication mechanism includes:
	1. **Forms Authentication:** Users provide credentials through a custom login form, and their identity is validated against a user store. If successful, an authentication ticket is created and stored in a cookie. It is commonly used mechanism.
	2. **Windows Authentication:** Utilizes the Windows credentials of the user, suitable for intranet applications where users are authenticated based on their Windows accounts. This type of authentication might required directory services like Active Directory. Here IIS performs the authentication, and the authenticated token is forwarded to the ASP.NET worker process.
	3. **Passport Authentication:** Centralized authentication service provided by Microsoft that offers single logon and core profile services for member sites.
	4. **None:** No Authentication provided. This is the default Authentication mode.
4. ASP.net also supports custom authentication providers. This simply means that you set the authentication mode for the application to none, then write your own custom code to perform authentication. For example, you might install an ISAPI filter in IIS that compares incoming requests to list of source IP addresses, and considers requests to be authenticated if they come from an acceptable address. In that case, you would set the authentication mode to none to prevent any of the .net authentication providers from being triggered.
5. When a user is authenticated, ASP.NET establishes a user identity, allowing the application to recognize them in subsequent requests. This is achieved through establishing session ids.
**Authorization:**
1. Authorization is a process which is used to implement proper accesss controls, it allows us to determine whether a logged in user is allowed to do a particular task or not, it can also help to determine if a user is allowed to access a particular functionality or not.
2. Authorization is orthogonal and independent from authentication. However, authorization requires an authentication mechanism.
3. Types of authorization in Asp.Net:
	1. **Role Based Authorization:** Users are assigned to roles, and access to resources is granted based on these roles. For example, an admin might have access to sensitive data, while regular users do not.
	2. **Claims Based Authorization:** Provides more granular control by allowing users to have multiple claims (attributes) that define their permissions.
	3. **Policy Based Authorization:** We can create policies that dictate access based on custom rules, enhancing flexibility.

##### <span style="color:blue;">5. What is AJAX? What are its advantages and disadvantages?</span>
1. AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a web development technique that allows web applications to send and receive data from a server asynchronously, without requiring a full page refresh
2. This technology enables a more dynamic and interactive user experience by allowing parts of a web page to be updated independently.
3. AJAX makes use of Xml Http Request Object in JavaScript to send ajax requests to web server.
4. With ajax we can send all kinds of request like GET, POST, HEAD, PUT etc with required data which can be processed on server side.
**Advantages of AJAX:**
1. AJAX allows for smoother interactions, reducing the need for full page reloads. Users can interact with the web application without interruption.
2. By only requesting and updating necessary data rather than entire pages, AJAX can decrease the amount of data transmitted between the client and server, leading to lower server load.
3. Asynchronous requests can improve application responsiveness, as users do not need to wait for a complete page refresh for updates.
4. You can update specific parts of a page based on user interactions (like filling out forms, clicking buttons), allowing for a more dynamic user interface.
5. AJAX supports richer interfaces, such as auto-suggest features and live validation, making applications feel more interactive.
**Disadvantages of AJAX:**
1. Implementing AJAX can increase the complexity of your application. Debugging and managing asynchronous requests can be more challenging than traditional synchronous requests.
2. While most modern browsers support AJAX, older browsers may not, which can lead to inconsistent user experiences across different platforms.
3. Search engines may not index content that is loaded dynamically via AJAX, which can affect the visibility of your web application in search results.
4. AJAX relies heavily on JavaScript, which means that if a user has JavaScript disabled, they will not be able to use the AJAX features of your application.
5. In some cases, frequent AJAX requests for small data updates can lead to increased overall bandwidth consumption compared to a single full-page request.

##### <span style="color:blue;">6. Write a short note on accordion control with appropriate properties.</span>
1. The Accordion control is a user interface component commonly used in web applications to organize and display content in a collapsible format.
2. It allows users to expand or collapse sections of content, making it easier to manage large amounts of information while maintaining a clean and organized layout.
3. We can load content dynamically into the panels using AJAX, which helps in reducing the initial page load time.
4. It enhances user experience by providing a structured way to navigate through information.
**Properties:**
1. **ActiveIndex:** Gets or sets the index of the currently active (expanded) panel. It is of integer type used to programmatically control which panel is expanded.
2. **MultipleExpand:** It is of boolean type used to get or set a value indicating whether multiple panels can be expanded at the same time.
3. **AnimationDuration:** It is integer type representing milliseconds used to get or set the duration of the animation when expanding or collapsing panels.
4. **HeaderTemplate:** Allows us to define a custom template for the header of each accordion panel.
5. **ContentTemplate:** Allows us to define a custom template for the content area of each accordion panel.
**Methods:**
1. **Expand(index):** Expands the panel at the specified index.
2. **Collapse(index):** Collapses the panel at the specified index.
3. **Clear():** Removes all panels from the Accordion control, it is used to reset the accordion and remove all content dynamically.
4. **Refresh():** Re-renders the Accordion control to reflect any changes made to the content or structure.

##### <span style="color:blue;">7. What is xml? List various classes of xml.</span>
1. XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language designed to store and transport data in a structured and human-readable format.
2. It  is similar to HTML i.e it contains tags, the tags can have attributes, data is stored between the tag. Xml allows developers to define their own tags, making it flexible and adaptable for various applications.
3. XML is commonly used for data interchange between systems, configuration files, and web services.
4. Data is organized in a tree-like structure, allowing for complex data representation.
5. XML can be used across different programming languages and platforms, facilitating interoperability. XML files are plain text, making them easy to read and write.
**Various Classes related to XML:**
1. **XmlDocument:** Represents an XML document and provides methods to manipulate the structure, such as loading, querying, and saving XML data.
2. **XmlReader:** - Provides a fast, forward-only cursor for reading XML data. It is useful for reading large XML files in a memory-efficient way.
3. **XmlWriter:** Provides a way to write XML data in a fast and efficient manner. It allows you to create XML documents programmatically.
4. **XDocument:** Part of the LINQ to XML API, it provides a modern approach to work with XML documents using LINQ (Language Integrated Query) for easier querying and manipulation.
5. **XElement:** - Represents a single XML element and can be used to create, modify, or query XML data.
6. **XmlSerializer:** Used to serialize and deserialize objects to and from XML format, making it easy to convert .NET objects into XML and vice versa.

##### <span style="color:blue;">8. Explain ScriptManager and Timer Control.</span>
**ScriptManager:**
1. The `ScriptManager` control is essential for enabling ASP.NET AJAX features. It manages client script for ASP.NET AJAX-enabled applications and is required for using other AJAX controls, like the `UpdatePanel`.
2. With ScriptManager control and other ajax controls we can use ajax without even using JavaScript.
3. It handles the loading of JavaScript libraries and scripts necessary for AJAX functionality.
4. It enables partial page rendering with `UpdatePanel`, allowing only specific parts of a page to be refreshed without a full postback.
5. We can register scripts for execution on the client side.  This makes them available to the page or user controls. This is useful for including external libraries or custom scripts.
6. Example:
	**Default.aspx**
```
<%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeFile="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="Default" %>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head runat="server">
    <title>ScriptManager Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form id="form1" runat="server">
        <asp:ScriptManager ID="ScriptManager1" runat="server" />
        <asp:UpdatePanel ID="UpdatePanel1" runat="server">
            <ContentTemplate>
                <asp:Label ID="Label1" runat="server" Text="Current Time: " />
                <asp:Button ID="Button1" runat="server" Text="Get Current Time" OnClick="Button1_Click" />
            </ContentTemplate>
        </asp:UpdatePanel>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```
	Default.aspx.cs
```
using System;

public partial class Default : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Label1.Text = "Current Time: " + DateTime.Now.ToString();
    }
}
```

**Timer Control**
1. The Timer control in ASP.NET is used to perform periodic postbacks to the server, allowing you to update parts of the page without requiring user interaction.
2. This is especially useful for scenarios like live data updates, such as displaying the current time, refreshing a stock price, or updating a chat application.
3. It works seamlessly with AJAX controls like **UpdatePanel**, this helps in allowing partial page updates and reducing the amount of data sent between the server and the client.
4. The Timer can be customized using client-side scripts to enhance user experience or functionality.
5. Here is a basic usage with an example:
	**Default.aspx**
```
<%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeFile="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="Default" %>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head runat="server">
    <title>Timer Control Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form id="form1" runat="server">
        <asp:ScriptManager ID="ScriptManager1" runat="server" />
        <asp:UpdatePanel ID="UpdatePanel1" runat="server">
            <ContentTemplate>
                <asp:Label ID="Label1" runat="server" Text="Current Time: " />
                <asp:Timer ID="Timer1" runat="server" Interval="1000" OnTick="Timer1_Tick" />
            </ContentTemplate>
        </asp:UpdatePanel>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```
	Default.aspx.cs
```
using System;

public partial class Default : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Timer1_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Label1.Text = "Current Time: " + DateTime.Now.ToString("hh:mm:ss tt");
    }
}
```

##### <span style="color:blue;">9. Explain AutoCompleteExtender in Asp.Net AJAX Control Toolkit.</span>
1. The `AutoCompleteExtender` is a component from the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit that enhances user input by providing suggestions as users type in a text box.
2. It’s commonly used in forms where you want to assist users by suggesting possible matches from a data source.
3. It works when a user type in the text box, the extender makes asynchronous calls to the server to fetch matching suggestions, improving the user experience.
4. This supports binding to various data sources, such as databases, web services, or even static lists.
5. **Properties of AutoCompleteExtender:**
	1. **TargetControlID:** The ID of the control (usually a `TextBox`) that will receive the autocomplete suggestions.
	2. **ServiceMethod:** The name of the server-side method that provides the suggestions. This method must be static and should return a collection (like `List<string>`).
	3. **MinimumPrefixLength:** The minimum number of characters that a user must type before the suggestions are fetched.
	4. **CompletionInterval:** The time (in milliseconds) to wait after the user stops typing before making a request to the server.
	5. **CompletionSetCount:** The maximum number of suggestions to return.
	6. **EnableCaching:** Indicates whether to cache the results of previous requests to improve performance.
	7. **DisplayMemberPath:** The property of the data item that is displayed in the suggestion dropdown. This is especially useful if you are binding to complex objects.
	8. **TextChanged:** The client-side event that occurs when the text in the associated control changes.
6. Basic usage with example:
**Default.aspx**
```
<%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeFile="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="Default" %>
<%@ Register Assembly="AjaxControlToolkit" Namespace="AjaxControlToolkit" TagPrefix="ajaxToolkit" %>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head runat="server">

        <asp:TextBox ID="TextBox1" runat="server"></asp:TextBox>
        <ajaxToolkit:AutoCompleteExtender 
            ID="AutoCompleteExtender1" 
            runat="server" 
            TargetControlID="TextBox1" 
            ServiceMethod="GetSuggestions" 
            MinimumPrefixLength="1" 
            CompletionInterval="1000" 
            CompletionSetCount="10" 
            EnableCaching="true" />
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```
**Default.aspx.cs**
```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Web.Services;

public partial class Default : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    [WebMethod]
    public static List<string> GetSuggestions(string prefixText, int count)
    {
        // Example static data for suggestions
        List<string> suggestions = new List<string>
        {
            "Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date", "Fig", "Grape", "Kiwi", "Lemon", "Mango", "Nectarine"
        };

        // Return filtered suggestions based on the prefix text
        return suggestions.FindAll(s => s.StartsWith(prefixText, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)).Take(count).ToList();
    }
}
```

##### <span style="color:blue;">10. How web.config file is used to implement forms authentication in Asp.Net.</span>
1. In ASP.NET, the `web.config` file is crucial for configuring forms authentication. This type of authentication allows users to log in using a form instead of using Windows authentication.
2. Since web.config file is an xml file, we need to use xml syntax to configure forms authentication.
3. We need to add authentication tag inside system.web tag in web.config file.
4. Then we need to set `mode` attribute of authentication tag to `Forms`.
5. We can then create a form element inside this authentication element, as shown below:
	`<forms loginUrl="~/Login.aspx" timeout="30" defaultUrl="~/Home.aspx" />`
6. We can set `defaultUrl` attribute of forms tag to any page which should be opened by default. In this page we can write logic to validate if user is authenticated or not by checking session id, if user isn't authenticated then we will redirect to Login.aspx page which is also value of `loginUrl` attribute of Forms tag.
7. In the Login.aspx page we could create a form where user can input and submit credentials to server and in the codebehind file of this page we could write logic to validate user credentials against a data store.
8. Example
```
<configuration>
  <system.web>
    <!-- Enable Forms Authentication -->
    <authentication mode="Forms">
      <forms loginUrl="~/Login.aspx" timeout="30" />
    </authentication>

    <!-- Authorization settings -->
    <authorization>
      <deny users="?" />  <!-- Deny all anonymous users -->
    </authorization>
    <httpRuntime targetFramework="4.5" />
  </system.web>
</configuration>
```

##### <span style="color:blue;">12. Explain the use of UpdateProgress control in AJAX.</span>
1. The `UpdateProgress` control in ASP.NET AJAX is used to provide feedback to users during asynchronous postbacks, such as when using an `UpdatePanel`. It displays a loading message or animation while a partial page update is being processed, enhancing user experience by indicating that a task is in progress.
2. It informs users that an operation is ongoing, which is especially important for actions that may take noticeable time to complete.
3. With UpdateProgress control we can customize the appearance of the loading indicator using CSS, making it fit seamlessly with your application's design.
4. It automatically shows when an `UpdatePanel` is being updated and hides when the update completes, making it easy to implement.
5. Example:
**Default.aspx**
```
<%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeFile="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="Default" %>
<%@ Register Assembly="AjaxControlToolkit" Namespace="AjaxControlToolkit" TagPrefix="ajaxToolkit" %>

<!DOCTYPE html>

    <style>
        /* Customize the appearance */
        #loadingMessage {
            background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
            color: white;
            padding: 20px;
            position: fixed;
            top: 50%;
            left: 50%;
            transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
            display: none; /* Hidden by default */
        }
    </style>

            <ContentTemplate>
                <asp:Label ID="Label1" runat="server" Text="Current Time: " />
                <asp:Button ID="Button1" runat="server" Text="Get Current Time" OnClick="Button1_Click" />

        <asp:UpdateProgress ID="UpdateProgress1" runat="server" AssociatedUpdatePanelID="UpdatePanel1">
            <ProgressTemplate>
                <div id="loadingMessage">Loading, please wait...</div>
            </ProgressTemplate>
        </asp:UpdateProgress>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```
**Default.aspx.cs**
```
using System;

public partial class Default : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Simulate a delay for demonstration purposes
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(2000); // 2 seconds delay
        Label1.Text = "Current Time: " + DateTime.Now.ToString("hh:mm:ss tt");
    }
}

##### <span style="color:blue;">13. Explain UpdatePanel.</span>
1. The `UpdatePanel` control in ASP.NET is a key component of the ASP.NET AJAX framework that enables partial page updates.
2. It allows us to update a portion of a web page asynchronously without requiring a full page refresh, improving the user experience and performance of web applications.
3. Only the content within the `UpdatePanel` is refreshed, which reduces the amount of data sent over the network and speeds up the response time. This also allows user to keep using other parts of  the web page without any interruption.
4. It works with standard ASP.NET controls and can be used in conjunction with other AJAX features, such as `UpdateProgress`.
5. **Properties:**
	1. **ChildrenAsTriggers:** When set to `true`, all child controls within the `UpdatePanel` will automatically trigger an update when they cause a postback.
	2. **UpdateMode:** Determines when the `UpdatePanel` is updated. This property can have values like - **Always** (this means panel updates on every postback) and **Conditional** (this means panel updates only when explicity triggered)
	3. **Triggers:** A collection that contains the triggers that cause the `UpdatePanel` to update. You can define specific controls and events that will trigger an update.
	4. **IsInUpdateProgress:** Indicates whether the `UpdatePanel` is currently in the process of updating.
6. **Methods:**
	1. **GetUpdateMode():** Retrieves the update mode of the `UpdatePanel`, either `Always` or `Conditional`.
	2. **RegisterAsyncPostBackControl(Control control):** Registers a control to be updated asynchronously. This is useful if you want to add a control dynamically that can trigger updates.
	3. **RemoveAsyncPostBackControl(Control control):** Unregisters a control from the `UpdatePanel`, meaning it will no longer trigger an asynchronous postback.
